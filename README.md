# PreciosaSite
preciosa.ro is a presentation website for a restaurant.
I build the frontend part of this website.The project was build in a custome CMS so from privacy reasons, I can't make the whole project public. You can find in repository HTML, Javascrip and stylesheet files.
Here is a link to the website: https://www.preciosa.ro

The project is build in HTML,JavaScript, custome CSS and Bootstrap 3, and the backend part represnt a hand build CMS that use PHP to dinamically insert HTML code into the website.
